<h2>Bridget Jones Diary</h2>
<h3>"At the start of the New Year, 32-year-old Bridget (Ren√©e Zellweger) decides it's time to take control of her life -- and start keeping a diary. Now, the most provocative, erotic and hysterical book on her bedside table is the one she's writing. With a taste for adventure, and an opinion on every subject - from exercise to men to food to sex and everything in between - she's turning the page on a whole new life." - Film synopsis</h3>
